Etch-a-sketch project

Instructions: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

// create 256 divs (16 x 16 grid) with js
// put them inside a container
// use flexbox to position elements in a grid
// be careful with borders and margins!
// hover effect upon hovering over a div (javascript event listener, add a class OR better: change bg color randomly using js)
// count the number of times the square has been hovered over, if less than 10 then darken color by 10%
// sketch pad should be 960px wide
// add a button on top of the screen, that will ask a user in a popup how many squares per side for the new grid, then generate it (same space; 960px)
// set limit to user input to 100
// add event listener to the button onclick to do the above
// use prompt to prompt user (you should be able to enter 64 and get 64x64 grid without changing width)
